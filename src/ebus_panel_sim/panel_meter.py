"""Panel-level aggregator. Pure function: takes resolved per-circuit gated powers
+ battery dispatch + grid online + manifest physics, returns the panel-level
fields that go into ``EbusPanelSnapshot``.

Stateless — all integration / accumulation lives in ``EnergyIntegrator``. This
module is just arithmetic over the current tick's inputs.

Two sign frames live on this reading, and they are not the same frame.

METER frame — positive = consumption, negative = production. Every field below
is a reading taken by one meter, about itself:
- Per-circuit ``power_w``: positive = consume, negative = produce (PV/V2G).
- ``battery_w``: positive = discharging (battery → panel), negative = charging.
- ``instant_grid_power_w``: positive = importing from grid, negative = exporting.
- ``upstream_active_power_w``: net power through the panel-side upstream lugs,
  before any upstream BESS contribution is removed.
- ``feedthrough_power_w``: net power flowing through the lugs to downstream
  loads (panel-side meter perspective).

NODE frame — positive = power LEAVING the panel node, negative = power ENTERING
it. The four ``power_flow_*`` fields are not four meters; they are the four
terms of one balance at one node, and a balance only closes if every term is
in the same frame. So PV (injecting) is negative, loads (drawing) are positive,
export (leaving) is positive, and a charging battery (drawing) is positive.

The two frames disagree about the same instant, on purpose. A panel exporting
2.5 kW publishes ``lugs-upstream/active-power`` negative and ``power-flows/grid``
positive simultaneously; both are correct, because they answer different
questions. Do not "make them consistent".

The balance is what makes the node frame checkable: hardware's four flows sum to
zero to the last digit it publishes. ``test_power_flows_sum_to_zero`` holds this
emitter to the same identity, which is why ``power_flow_grid`` is derived from
the physics below rather than back-solved from the other three — a residual
would satisfy the test by construction and detect nothing.

Off-grid: when ``grid_online`` is False, ``instant_grid_power_w`` is 0 by
definition (grid is electrically disconnected); battery and PV cover load."""
